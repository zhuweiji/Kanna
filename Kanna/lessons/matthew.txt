okay anyway uh after series right the next one we gotta talk about will be parallel circuits can so whats so special about parallel leh lets take a look parallel also got a few rules to follow can okay but take note parallel uh in parallel circuits the batteries and resistors are on different but parallel wires can so what does it look like it looks like ladder ah the lines are parallel to each other so what are the two rules again right rule number one current must split at a junction so whats a junction ah over here the junction uh is actually this black dot here ah i bet everybody here went to a traffic light junction before when you go to a traffic light junction right you got option right you can either cross the road or make a right make a left that kind of thing same for the current when a current reaches a junction it has an option to either go in this case it has the option to either go down or go to your left can okay so now the question to ask yourself ay is the current going to split equally no most of the time current dont split equally at the junction kay why cause most of the time they dont actually give you resistors of equal resistance can okay unless you're in primary school but now you're in secondary school right resistance will never be the same okay can so over here right just need to take note i naught will split into i one plus i two okay if they split into i one i two i one i two must add up to give you i naught again current splits at a junction current must also add back at the junction okay thats number one number two after we talk about current we must talk about voltage again okay so whats the voltage over here potential difference across parallel wires are equal okay so we see ah over here this wire over here is parallel to this wire is parallel to that wire can you see all wires are parallel to each other so if i tell you that my emf the batter uh is the voltage of the battery is ten volts that means the voltage on v one must also be ten the voltage of v two must also be two current eh sorry voltage must always be the same finally okay to add the resistance in uh parallel use this formula one over r total is equal to one over r one plus one over r two plus r three so why r two plus r three because you see r two r three right they are in series you gotta add them first before you inverse can okay then you test the student
